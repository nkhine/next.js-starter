My personal and opinionated way to get started on Next.js projects with most optimal configuration possible.

## Features

- Minimal bleeding edge Next.js 12 boilerplate w/ React 18
- Prioritized for css-in-js using [Stitches](https://stitches.dev), w/ theme support
- Pre-configured with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier out of the box
- Project structure based off of [bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react)
- Simple but useful demo features theme handling, and data fetched and displayed with [ssr](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)

### Included Libraries

- [sanitize.css](https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css): CSS library that provides consistent, cross-browser default styling of HTML elements alongside useful defaults

- [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes): Abstraction for handling themes in Next.js and features no flash on load (both SSR and SSG)

- [@radix-ui/colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors): Library that provides palletes and color scales for design and pairs well with Stitches and next-themes

- [reactive-button](https://arifszn.com/reactive-button/docs): Tiny 3D animated React button library with zero dependencies

- [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro): Promise based HTTP client with developer friendly API and automatic transforms

#### UI Libraries

- [radix-ui/primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com): Low-level UI component library with a focus on accessibility, customization and developer experience

- [@nextui-org/react](https://nextui.org): More "complete" UI library that already uses stitches under the hood, and allows for a fast and modern UI regardless of design experience

#### Icons

- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons): Library with svg icons of popular icon packs built for React

#### Data Fetching

- [swr](https://swr.vercel.app): React hooks for data fetching, and more lightweight alternative 
to react-query
